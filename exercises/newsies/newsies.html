        <h2>The World is Chill Now</h2>

        <p>
            The world is now chill. Everyone has apparently chilled out and stop stressing. There appears to not have been any war or
            confliction in the last week. Some people are weirded out by it, but are instantly chill once they entered their
            homes for a while. All debt has been removed and even the animals are relaxing in the sun, enjoying the green
            grass.
